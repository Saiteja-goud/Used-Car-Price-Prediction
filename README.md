# 1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The automotive industry is a dynamic market where used car pricing plays a crucial role in sales, financing, and insurance evaluations. Pricing a used car accurately is a challenging problem due to the influence of multiple factors such as mileage, age, engine performance, accidents, transmission type, and brand reputation. Traditional valuation methods rely on historical sales trends and expert knowledge, but they often fail to capture the intricate relationships between different variables. Manual pricing often leads to inefficiencies, underpricing, or overpricing. Machine Learning (ML) offers a data-driven solution by predicting prices based on historical sales trends.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of a used car based on its features. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection with hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using Django. By automating price estimation, the model provides insights for dealerships, individual buyers, and financial institutions



# 1.2 Problem Statement
Accurately predicting the price of a used car is a challenging task due to multiple interacting factors. Traditional rule-based systems do not scale well and often fail to capture complex relationships between features. This research focuses on building an ML model that provides reliable price estimates based on a car's attributes.



# 1.3 Objective
1.	Develop a predictive model that estimates the price of a used car using historical data.
2.	Compare different machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model.
3.	Deploy the trained model as a web application using Django for real-time user interaction.


# 1.4 Use Cases and Target Audience
This system can benefit multiple stakeholders:
•	Car buyers: Determine if a listed car price is fair.
•	Sellers and dealerships: Optimize selling price.
•	Online marketplaces: Provide automated price recommendations.


# 1.5 Methodology and Pipeline
1.	Data Ingestion: Load and clean the dataset from CSV files.
2.	Feature Engineering: Extract relevant attributes, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical data.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns, correlations, and key factors influencing used car prices.
4.	Model Selection & Tuning: Train and optimize multiple models using GridSearchCV.
5.	Evaluation: Measure performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
6.	Deployment: Deploy the final model using Django for real-time predictions via a web-based API.
